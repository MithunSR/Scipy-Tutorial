        "In the ODE systems and solvers section, we demonstrate how to define a system of ODEs using the odeint() function from scipy.integrate. We define a simple ODE system consisting of two equations, and the odeint() function is used to numerically solve the system over a given time interval. The result includes the solution for each equation at different time points.\n",

        "The initial value problems section focuses on solving ODEs with initial conditions. We define a second-order ODE and its initial conditions. The solve_ivp() function from scipy.integrate is used to solve the initial value problem numerically. The result includes the solution for the ODE over the specified time interval.\n",

The solve_bvp() function from scipy.integrate is employed to solve the boundary value problem numerically. The result includes the solution for the ODE over the specified interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scipy's capabilities in solving ODEs numerically and performing numerical integration make it a powerful tool for modeling and simulating dynamic systems. The ability to handle both initial value problems and boundary value problems allows for a wide range of applications, from simulating physical systems to analyzing biological processes."
