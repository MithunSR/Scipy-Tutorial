        "In the optimization section, we demonstrate how to use Scipy to find the minimum of a given objective function. The objective function is defined as a quadratic function, and the minimize() function from scipy.optimize is used to find its minimum. The result includes the minimum value and the corresponding minimizer.\n",

We define a model function (exponential function) and generate some data points with added noise. The curve_fit() function from scipy.optimize is employed to fit the curve to the data, providing optimized parameters as the result.\n",

        "In the linear programming section, Scipy's capabilities for linear programming are demonstrated. The objective function and inequality constraints are defined for a linear programming problem. The linprog() function from scipy.optimize is employed to solve the linear programming problem and find the optimal solution. The result includes the minimizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code provides a concise and illustrative example of how Scipy can be used for optimization tasks, curve fitting, root finding, and linear programming. Scipy's optimization algorithms, constraints handling, and ability to work with non-linear functions make it a powerful tool for a wide range of scientific and engineering applications."
